# PyFlap

A STEM project for schools.

This is a simple flappy bird game written in Python and using PyGame. 

It is based on a Java/libGDX implementation that I first delivered at the Cheltenham College Day of Code in Feb 2015. 

Java proved to be a little heavy to teach to year 9 students in a day, so hopefully Python will be easier.
